She balances easily on the other foot despite the high wedge heel of the boots. \n\nA midi skirt length black sweater dress with a low cut v-neck collar clings to her angles and curves. There is a silver Chinese dragon picked out in exquisite stitching slithering its way around her body, up and across across the dress. It bares its fangs on her left breast.\n\nDiamond ear studs sparkle next to incredibly pale smooth skin as she pushes a curtain of dark rich hair back from her face with one hand.

The gallery keeps unusually late hours and the owner is a well known Boston eccentric.\n\nOutside a velvet rope keeps a small crowd of coated mist breathing people at bay. This is a private art showing. Supplicants who approach the door without invitations or appropriate escorts are aggressively inspected by the bouncers and most often relegated to the rope line based on some invisible criteria.\n\nVery occasionally the roped group of hopefuls is inspected by an invitation bearing patron. Lucky individuals are selected to be escorted inside by their new invitation bearing patron.\n\nFor the most part arrivals at the gallery are couples or small intimate groups. Some arrive on foot strolling easily through the chill winter air. Others disembark from luxurious vehicles and walk the red carpet which extends to the curb.\n\nMost who approach the door present embossed invitations to the two well dressed and assertively thorough door guardians. An exclusive few sail up to and through doors held wide for them by suddenly deferential doormen without showing any paper invitations.\n\nOnce inside, the main gallery space is large, ultra modern, with dim corners and bright lights bathing the gray walls and displayed paintings. The space is set up for socializing  as well as art viewing with open mingling spaces and a bar. An eclectic mix of music plays throughout the space, soft conversations sparkle, and unusually demonstrative public displays of affection are common.\n\nThe art on display tonight is by the young up and coming artist Theadora. This series is neo-surrealistic, almost photo perfectly rendered paintings in intense colors. Classical elements like greek columns, Michelangelo's sculptures, stain glass windows, stone angels, and ancient floating temple sites are combined in surrealistic scenes bathed in eerie glows or pierced by strong shafts of light.\n\nIt is a civilized and elegant affair. This is an important social occasion designed to re-stabilize Boston vampire society.\n\nFor those with eyes to see, the crowd is mixed with Initiates of the Blood clearly outnumbering the mortals. The mortals are  attached to Vampire consorts, sometimes circulating independently for awhile, but inevitably returning to orbit their dark counterparts. \n\nThe vast majority of the Kindred present are  centenarians or younger. The younger they are in the blood, the more difficult it is to tell apart from the mortals. \n\nThere are a few outstanding exceptions moving about the gallery or holding court in private corners, clearly older and more powerful. These individuals are treated with deference, their personal space carefully respected.\n\nYou enter this glittering and volatile environment with knowledge or ignorance, fears or hopes, a place in this complex society or woefully in need of an introduction and maybe some protection.",

It must be late afternoon. *Oh fuck* is all Ian\u2019s mind can summon up.\n\nJahan knows he will not wake Kieran who rests in Ian\u2019s small bed quiet as a stone with a little smile on his face. Their bond will keep him quiescent and trusting. \n\n\u201cI see you have decided to appropriate my lover and oversleep your duties. You are a very bold young man.\u201d There is no rancor in his voice but his eyebrow is arched.\n\nIan struggles out of Kieran\u2019s embrace, scrambling out of bed to go to his knees in front of Jahan head bowed.\n\n\u201cYou have been taking advantage of the safety of our bond and sneaking in to nap with me while I rest in the middle of the day haven\u2019t you? I can smell you when I wake you know. And this afternoon I wasn\u2019t available so\u2026\u201d Jahan prompts Ian for a response.\n\n\u201cYes Master Jahan. I have been lying down to rest with you.\u201d He sounds a little ashamed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would mind. And Kieran\u2026 he says he wants me.\u201d That statement is proud, almost defiant.\n\n\u201cDid he? And you gave yourself to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, well not entirely, no. But I could.\u201d Ian seems to be considering it.\n\n\u201cYou have some duties to perform and you owe me some study time from yesterday evening\u2026 don\u2019t you Ian?\u201d Ian won\u2019t require more than this cool disapproving tone.\n\nIndeed, Ian is entirely contrite. \u201cYes Master. I do. Please forgive me.\u201d Ian\u2019s hand rises to rest feather light against Jahan\u2019s thigh, a motion of elegant supplication. \n\nJahan takes Ian\u2019s hand and raises the young man up, drawing his forearm all the way to his lips,  supporting and biting him casually even as his eyes covetously trace every curve and plane of Kieran\u2019s naked resting body.

They wear light robes, pink silk and black linen, belted loose and inviting around their respective waists.  A plate of dates sits on the floor within reach, and they eat them idly as they chat.  \n\n\u201c... I thought about studying psychology but really found myself at home in political public relations. It\u2019s more interesting than marketing because you are dealing with people and ideas as your commodity and it isn\u2019t just focused on making money,\u201d concludes Lena.\n\n\u201cWhat did you want to do, ultimately\u2026 Or should I say \u2018what do you want to do?\u2019  I don\u2019t know if this is permanent for you.\u201d Esmina gestures with half a date, taking in their decadent surrounding. \n\nLena sucks some sticky fruit off her finger before replying. \u201cIt will be hard to beat the intimate personal assistant to a Prince gig I have now.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill political public relations, I suppose.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes and I have a feeling my current position may grow in that direction\u2026 look at your involvement here. Things are shifting. I might get into Boston politics on my own recognizance in another five years. I happen to know a financial donor with deep pockets who would back me.\u201d Lena smiles wickedly and lifts her eyebrows for emphasis. \u201cFor now, more fun, less work.\u201d\n\nLena looks up from her conversation with Esmina, \u201cGood evening Jahan.\u201d  Deeply sensitized to his presence, she felt more than heard him approach, his bare feet on the carpet making no sound at all.\n\nIan emerges from a curtained alcove wearing a long white robe of some kind. He practically scurries through the room heading for the door out to the hallway. He clearly is on a mission, no time to socialize.

For a moment she has the insane notion that it is Stasie coming to bed just as she has for countless mornings.  When that impossible sense of hope draws her tear worn eyes up, she finds the light footstep belongs to Iris.\n\nThe look on Iris\u2019s face is a perfect mirror of the grief that Rossa feels. She hovers in the doorway disheveled and uncertain, tears dripping down her face slowly, one after another.\n\n***\n\nBaltisar slams the car door shut behind him and pauses to *listen* as Jahan and Joanna go on to their rooms below the manor.  Iris is here.\n\nIt is a relief to find her here and relatively quiet. Iris is a wild card, loyal, capable, but never the less risky as an ally. Learning that she was working closely with Jahan, that he had been reading Iris telepathically and teaching her skills had given Baltisar substantial pause... watching as Jahan dug around in her disordered mind tonight was practically panic inducing. At least the result of her studying with Jahan seems to have been that she has learned to block, and to keep her secrets.\n\nBaltisar listens awhile longer, reaching, searching... some part of him still expects to find Prince Stephen in the house. Nothing. He shakes his head at his own foolishness. Even if Stephen were in the house, their bond is long since faded. The only old powerful vampire present is Jahan. If Stephen were here, Baltisar wouldn't have to look for him.

The younger vampire is still out cold, dead to the world.  He\u2019ll be out for a little while yet.  The loft\u2019s big windows are covered in heavy, layered curtains, except for one left open to nourish the huge tree that dominates that window.  It throws a lacy shadow across the hardwood floor.

The club and other business establishments run by vampire interests would be closed. I believe this will give us time to consider, rest and regroup.
