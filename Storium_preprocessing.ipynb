These bring different cards together and effectively preprocesses them so that we can send them inside our model. Now, in data exploration, we talked about constraints and how these can be implemented using Cassoway Algorithm. Constraints are essential because they offer a way to control the length and contents of the segments. Since many of the models that we would be finetuning with allow a fixed context window, these constraints will allow us to flexibiliy change the context window. We don't need to worry about the creation of segments as the process itself is streamlined in the github repository associated with the dataset. A high-level overview would be fine for the project we are considering (which builds on the original work as we talked about).\n",

On my way, I have modified some of the functions so that their logic is clear to everyone in the group.  My main aim with this is to see step-by-step how each story is being processed.

There has to be some correlation in those numbers that your model needs to pick on for it to meaningfully learn). \n",

The authors have also added a functionality that suppress warnings related to text length exceeding the maximum length allowed by the tokenizer. However, all in all, its a pretty normal function. Let me briefly mention the **extract_string** function in this context. It is called again and again when we are tokenizing text. What it does is that it retrieves a string value from a dictionary based on a specified field name. If the field exists in the dictionary and its corresponding value is not None, the function returns that value as a string. \n",

    "- At 5’6 with long auburn hair and grey eyes that can slip silver if they catch the light the right way, 25 year old Alenteile O’Shaughnessy can only be described as disarming. Her bright, energetic personality is warm and engaging with a hint of mischief, as if she’s keeping a secret that she’d love to share. In truth, she’s got two. \n",

    "    First, she is in service to a newly arrived vampire master, running his errands and making sure that his day to day needs are met without interruption. Second, she is his lover and share his hunger for young, pretty lovers and *all* that they offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "    This petite beauty looks innocent, but she knew at an early age that the sight, smell and taste of blood was a sexual turn on. She tried for a long time to hide that part of herself away, channeling her energies into gymnastics and her academic studies. She knew that to “go goth” would just bring this most taboo secret to the surface. Only once did she come close to letting that part of herself show.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As a teen, she scratched a lover during sex, drawing blood. Unable to help herself, she attacked, her craving overwhelming her. She was able to inveigle her way out of the situation, but it taught her a powerful lesson – hold fast to your “humanity”, no matter the temptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So she overachieved at “normal” so she could pass in a world that would revile her if they knew her truth. And she got really good at it. She honed her ability to charm folks, getting them to lower their defenses so she could sneak in, around, away if needs be. Then she met someone who not only couldn’t she beguile, but who saw her for who she truly was … Jahan AlBenir.\n",
    "\n",
    "    She met Jahan at Diva's in her Junior year at Smith College in Western MA. He was exotic, exciting and, as she came to find out, enjoyed her most when she let go of her inhibitions … all of her inhibitions. Eventually, she left school and moved in with him, taking the roles of “daywalker”, housekeeper, lover, procurer. She shares his home, his bed, his lovers and his meals but never his blood, no matter how he pleads with her to join him. The childhood lesson has stayed with her as she adamantly refuses to become an immortal herself … however tempting. And Jahan is forever tempting.\n",

    "- Anastasie d'Estouteville was born in France, 1530, the youngest daughter of the Duke of Estouteville. As the daughter of a duke Anastasie enjoyed many privileges, at an early age she learnt what a woman must in a 16th century french society. She quickly gained impeccable social graces and etiquette and learnt later in her years how to navigate the intrigues of court. Unlike many women of her time her father recognized the potential within her and ensured that she receive a comprehensive education and employed later her within his court. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Anastasie knew from an early age that her family were somehow different. Despite their duke and duchess titles her parents were recluses. She rarely saw or spoke to either of her parents, and although it saddened her she was content to live a solitary life of learning. She understood that her parents were busy tending to the needs of their people.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As the clock tuned 12 o clock on her twenty first birthday Anastasie's life as she knew it was no more and in its place was a sordid life of corruption and deceit. As she awoke to the sound of whispering she noted that she was not in her room nor her home, she was surrounded by veiled figures in a damp and somber room. It was in that room she first heard the tales of creatures that live in darkness and preyed upon the people of her land. It was in that room she was told that the tales were not works of fiction but of reality. And it was in that room she was told she would on her twenty forth birthday she would be initiated into their society of vampires of which her father,the Duke, headed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Anastasie was soon forced to become a vampire and in the three years that followed she was taught how to be the perfect predator. How to kill devoid of emotion, how to stalk and hunt pray at night and made to memorize the history and philosophy of their society. Anastasie within the period of a few short years morphed from a kind hearted child to a woman she no longer recognized. The society in many ways had accomplished their goals, she became ruthless, at the best amoral, cold and unforgiving. She was truly the perfect vampire, stronger and quicker than those far older than herself. Although there was one factor the society had not accounted for. Anastasie despised the society, and loathed her family for all they had done to her.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On Anastasie's twenty fourth birthday  (now three years a vampire), when she was officially part of the society and permitted to leave her compound she made her way to her families castle and slaughtered every inhabitant in the dead of night, including her mother and father. After obtaining her revenge she fled the country in a futile attempt to avaid the societies far reaching influence. \n",
    "\n",

    "    Anastasie is learned and wise, throughout the years she has retained and improved upon her diplomatic and court skills. A natural leader she is authoritative, inspiring and realistic paired with a cunning mind makes her a master at the game. She has risen high in the vampire hierarchy, being a powerful member of the former princes court. Anastasie has recently become a rich businesswoman as she dominates the lucrative underground vampire social life scene, being the proud owner of the most prominent and notorious vampire clubs and blood dens.\n",

A variety of tattoos cover her slim yet curvaceous body in place of the scars she once wore before and during her three year period of transformstion with elaborate art describing the situations in which they were acquired and what lesson she may have learned from the experience. Anastasie reapplies the fading tattoos each week and has done so for nearly five hundred years. The only brand which is truly permanent is that of her societies initials positioned on the back of both of her wrists.*\n",
